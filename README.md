*Introduction:*

Dicoding Collection (DiCo) is an online fashion company that recognizes the value of data-driven decision making. They meticulously store all their sales history, product information, and customer details in a centralized database. This project aims to leverage this data to analyze DiCo's sales performance, identify top-selling and underperforming products, and gain valuable insights into their customer demographics. By understanding their customer base better, DiCo can develop more effective marketing campaigns.

*Data Analysis Process:*

This project will follow a structured data analysis approach consisting of the following key steps:

1. Business Questions:

2. *Data Wrangling:* 
    - In this initial phase, we will clean and prepare the data from the four tables (customers, orders, products, and sales) within the database. This might involve tasks like removing inconsistencies, fixing missing values, and formatting data for optimal analysis. 

3. *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):* 
    - Once the data is wrangled, we will perform an initial exploration to uncover patterns and trends. This might include calculating summary statistics, identifying relationships between variables, and visualizing the data to gain a deeper understanding. 

4. *Data Visualization:* 
    - To effectively communicate our findings, we will create visual representations of the data. This could involve charts, graphs, or other infographics that clearly showcase trends and patterns identified during the EDA stage. 

5. *Draw Conclusion:* 
    - After analyzing the prepared data and visualizations, we will draw conclusions about DiCo's sales performance, customer demographics, and product popularity. This will involve interpreting the findings and formulating actionable insights that can inform business decisions.

*Project Deliverables:*

- A comprehensive report outlining the analysis process, key findings, and actionable insights.
- Data visualizations that effectively communicate the project's conclusions.

#### RFM Analysis

To figure out which customers are the most important, we can use something called RFM analysis. This method looks at three things about each customer:

Recency: How long ago did they buy something from us?

Frequency: How often do they buy from us?

Monetary Value: How much money do they spend when they shop with us?

By looking at these three things, we can see which customers are buying from us recently, often, and spending the most money.

# ðŸ“šConclusions and Recommendations
- Conclusions
  - Based on the company's sales and revenue results in the last few months, it can be seen that March had the highest number of orders, with 117 orders. However, there was a significant decrease in the number of orders in February, April, May and October. This also has an impact on company revenue. To overcome this decline, further analysis needs to be carried out regarding factors such as the existence of competitors and marketing campaigns.

  - In terms of product sales, Denim products were the most sold with 527 units, while Mandarin Collar products were the least sold with 236 units.

  - Customer demographics show that most customers do not disclose information about their gender. However, the majority of customers are in the adult age group, with 416 customers. Most customers come from the state of South Australia.

  - Lastly, customers made transactions at least a day ago, some even made transactions on the same day. A customer usually makes five or six purchases in the last few months. The customer who spent the most money was AUD 7632.

- Recommendations
  - Based on these results, companies can focus more on increasing sales in months with decreasing orders. Apart from that, companies can also expand their marketing strategies and identify new opportunities to attract more customers. It is also important to maintain and increase existing customer satisfaction by providing good service and quality products.
